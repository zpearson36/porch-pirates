 Going with IDEA 1

 todo list:
  - player character can move around
  - walk over "packages" to collect them
  - a round lasts a finite amount of time (in game 9 - 5, its a full time job)
  - have people walking around whose vision you must avoid while taking package
  - end of day total determines the next days profile level
  - effects of higher profile
  - - More alert neighbors
  - - appearance of security cameras
  - - increased police patrols
  - ways to counteract higher profile
  - - new clothes
  - - a disguise
  - - plastic surgery?
  - - dog toy to distract dogs
  - - single use camera disruptors?
  - - Buy off police (those corrupt fuckers)
  - player has a bulk/weight limit
  - - once limit is reached, player must drop off packages to getaway car.
  - - bulkier makes you more suspicious
  - - heavier weight makes you move slower
  - - can buy upgrades to increase limits
  - Maybes?
  - - have a charisma level that affects how suspicious people think you are
